This is the frontend project for Map-Mate. Map-Mate is an application letting user create, customize, and collaborate on geolocational maps. This project utilizes Mapbox Api for the map itself, as well as a Ruby on Rails backend, found here: https://github.com/nicklevenson/maps-backend. 

If you'd like to run this on your local machine, you may want clone down the backend as  well. You must have all dependencies installed, run rails s for the backend server, and npm start for the frontend React server. 

Have fun and please report any bugs or suggestions!
